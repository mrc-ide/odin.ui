## Load and Save

### Key points

*Remember to save your work regularly.*
The server will disconnect you if you are inactive for too long.
Pressing the back button on your browser, or refreshing the page, will also cause you to lose your work.

### Load

You can load a previously saved session by clicking on `Browse` and opening the relevant file.
Remember you still have to click on the variables you want to visualise in the `Sensitivity` tab.

### Save

You can save a session which will allow you to come back to the model at a later time.
This saves the model code, parameter values, and the plots.

### Remote

The app will periodically save your session to our servers.  Sessions are listed in the table on the right side by time, with the most recent at the top by default.  You can add a label to help you remember what you are doing, but this is optional.

To load a session, select one row in the table by clicking it, then press the "Load" button.

You can remove saved sessions by selecting multiple entries in the table (click, then shift click to select a range) and clicking "Clear".
